Dukkhapatta ca nidukkha
Bhayappatta ca nibbhaya
Sokappatta ca nissoka
Hontu sabbepi panino

Ettavata ca amhehi Sambhatam punnasampadam
Sabbe devanumodantu, Sabbasampattisiddhiya

Danam dadantu saddhaya, Silam rakkhantu sabbada
Bhavanabhirata hontu, Gacchantu devatagata

Sabbe Buddha balappatta
Paccekananca yam balam
Arahantanca tejena
Rakkham bandhami sabbaso

Having got suffering, may they not suffer
Having got fear, may they not fear
Having got grief, may they not grieve
Thus all beings may they be

To the extent that by us Punna/merits has been attained and collected
May all Devas rejoice in and share it for the attainment of all fortune

By faith should gifts be given, virtue should always be protected
Delightful should meditation be, and all the deities who are present here may return to their respective abodes

By all Buddhas attained to power and the power of the Solitary Ones and by the might of the Arahants I bind this thread in every way for protection.
